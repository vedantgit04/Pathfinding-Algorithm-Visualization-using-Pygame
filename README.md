# Pathfinding-Algorithm-Visualization-using-Pygame
This project visualizes popular pathfinding algorithms—Breadth-First Search (BFS), Depth-First Search (DFS), Dijkstra, and A*—using Python and Pygame. The visualization provides an interactive platform to understand how these algorithms work in real-time to find the shortest path between two points on a grid..
